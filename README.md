Parser, that periodically checks new events on [standupstore.ru](https://standupstore.ru/) and posts notifications to telegram channel.

### Quick start
1. Install git, docker and docker-compose
2. Clone repo
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:dvabidonamoloka/standupstoreparser.git

3. Add settings.py to `susp/` folder by the following template:
    ```python
    TOKEN = 'your_telegram_bot_token'
    CHAT_ID = '@your_telegram_channel_name'

    EXCEPTIONS_EMAIL_TO = 'email'  # email to which you will receive error logs
    EXCEPTIONS_EMAIL_FROM = 'email'  # email from which error logs will be sent
    SMPT_SERVER = 'smpt_server_adress'
    SMPT_PORT = 'smpt_server_port'
    SMPT_PASSWORD = 'password of email from which error logs will be sent'
    ```
    Note, that telegram bot has to be the admin of the channel
